# krusty
A toy OS for the Raspberry Pi, written in C and Rust. Hopefully it actually works 

## Things to install
```
linaro aarch64-none-elf gcc toolchain for cross compiling (theres binaries you can download)
[qemu w/ raspi3 support](https://github.com/bztsrc/qemu-raspi3)
[xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo)
```
Need to be on linux for smooth experience
## After setting up prerequisite toolchains
The Makefile should be able to compile all parts and link them together
